            <p>I am Front-End Developer with Full-Stack capabilities. I have 2+ years of experience designing and building websites that empower independent artists and art institutions to deepen their work inside the communities they serve. With 10+ years of experience as a performing artist, I am uniquely positioned to center the aesthetic and experiential inside of software development. My work is to build technology directed at uplifting communities it serves and increase the impact of their human contributions. As a trans, queer performing artist working inside the tech industry, I am looking for and seek to uphold a work environment that parallels my disruptive energy, history, and perspective and looks to increase their socially driven impacts.</p>
            <p>I am one of the founding partners at FAILSPACE Design Services, a web development and graphic design agency dedicated to empowering independent artists. I believe that good design comes from cultivating relationships. In 2+ years, my team and I have worked with dozens of clients, and from this experience we have shaped FAILSPACEâ€™s distinctive client interaction model that now includes brand development, wireframing, UI/UX design, website development, and final deliverable hand-off. Together we are delivering brands that are uniquely representative of our clients alongside powerful technology that empowers client growth inside their industry.</p>
