                        <p className="white">I am a digital creative who thrives in being in the room conceptualizing and ideating with a team of designers as well as engineering UX/UI solutions. For 2+ years, I have been working with FAILSPACE Design Services, a design agency that supports artists and arts institutions, in designing and building web applications. In addition to my technical background, I bring my 10+ years of experience shaping audience experience as a choreographer. My expertise in choreographing AFK experiences uniquely positions me as a UX/UI engineer who is able to center the aesthetic and experiential inside of software engineering. As a trans, queer performing artist working inside the tech industry, I am looking for and seek to uphold a work environment that parallels my disruptive energy, history, and perspective and looks to increase their socially driven impacts.</p>
                        <p className="white">I am one of the founding partners at FAILSPACE Design Services, a web development and graphic design agency dedicated to empowering independent artists. I believe that good design comes from cultivating relationships. In 2+ years, my team and I have worked with dozens of clients, and from this experience we have shaped FAILSPACEâ€™s distinctive client interaction model that now includes brand development, wireframing, UI/UX design, website development, and final deliverable hand-off. Together we are delivering brands that are uniquely representative of our clients alongside powerful technology that empowers client growth inside their industry.</p>
