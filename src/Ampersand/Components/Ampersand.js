            <p>Ampersand Paris is an interdisciplinary performing artist and fermentation revivalist. They are the founder of FAILSPACE and design partner at FAILSPACE Design Services. Their current practice is a fermentation CSA that sustainably feeds community while cultivating a trans-microbiopolitic for making and being. They concern themselves with taking care of nearly invisible things: bacteria, yeast, lines of code, and the liminal space of trans existence. Their overlapping processes of fermentation, decomposition, self-portraiture, computer programming, and performance improvisation build relationships to these invisible forces and illuminate their world-shaping impacts. Their desire is to learn the technologies of the small in order to care for big transformations necessary to survive, if not effervesce, in climate ruin.</p>
