# Ampersand Paris Website

# Description 
Ampersand Paris's website uses a dual navigation system to toggle between her work as a software engineer and interdisciplinary creative. The web design in its colors and structure mirrors how her work seeks to be both disruptive and multirelational in all that she does. The webiste is a React App with custom mobile responsive CSS. The website is hosted on Netlify. (https://ampersand.paris)
